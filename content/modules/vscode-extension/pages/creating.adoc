= Creating a Project

One essential thing you need to have before creating the project is the GraphQL schema file, which is developed as a part of the backend. This schema file describes the capabilities of the application backend.

After making sure that we have it, we go to VS Code and start creating the frontend project.

From the VS Code start screen press *_Ctrl+Shift+P_* to make the *_Show All Commands_* window appear.

Type *_Amplicode_* into the search field. From the results that appear, select *_Amplicode: Init Frontend_*.

The next parameter to enter will de *_Destination_*. Click on the *_Folder_* icon and pick the folder that you want to contain your project. You can create it, if necessary, from the same window.

The result will look as below. Press *_Enter_*.

The next parameter to choose will be Client Type. Select *_React Admin Based_*.

On the next step, you name the project.

The next step will be to upload the `.graphqls` file. Upload the GraphQL schema file that you have in your backend project.

For *_Backend Port_* keep the default value of 8080. For *_Generator Version_* use the current default value. Click *_Generate_*.

== Opening the Project

Wait while the extension installs all the necessary packages. Once the process is completed, you will get a prompt to open the freshly generated project.

Click *_Open generated project_*.

[IMPORTANT]
You will have to be extremely quick to use this prompt, since it only stays on the screen for a few seconds. If you have missed it, there is still an alternative way described below.

=== The Alternative

Click on the *_Explorer_* icon.

Open the folder by clicking *_Open Folder_* button.

Whichever way you use to open the project, if you are opening this folder for the first time, VS Code will ask you if you trust the authors of the project. Click *_Yes, I trust the authors_*.

VS Code will proceed to open the project that you have just created. You should see the project tree on the left now.
