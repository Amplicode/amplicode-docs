= Creating a Project

One essential thing you need to have before creating the project is the GraphQL schema file, which is developed as a part of the backend. This schema file describes the capabilities of the application backend.

After making sure that we have it, we go to VS Code and start creating the frontend project.

From the VS Code start screen press *_Ctrl+Shift+P_* to make the *_Show All Commands_* window appear.

Type *_Amplicode_* into the search field. From the results that appear, select *_Amplicode: Init Frontend_*.

The next parameter to enter will de *_Destination_*. Click on the *_Folder_* icon and pick the folder that you want to contain your project. You can create it, if necessary, from the same window.

The result will look as below. Press *_Enter_*.

The next parameter to choose will be Client Type. Select *_React Admin Based_*.

On the next step, you name the project.

The next step will be to upload the `.graphqls` file. Choose the file that we previously stored (petclinic.graphqls) in a separate folder and upload it.

For *_Backend Port_* keep the default value of 8080. For *_Generator Version_* use the current default value. Click *_Generate_*.

Wait while the extension installs all the necessary packages.

Click on the *_Explorer_* icon.

Open the folder (there will be a prompt), click *_Trust the Author_*. The project has been created. You can see the project tree on the left now.
