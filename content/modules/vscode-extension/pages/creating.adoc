= Creating a Project

Before creating a new frontend project in VS Code, you will need to run the corresponding backend application in IntelliJ IDEA using the debug icon (image:debug.png[align=center]).

We also recommend to make a copy of the `schema.graphqls` file from the backend project (located in `<project folder>\src\main\resources\graphql`), put it in a separate folder (e.g. *_Downloads_*) and rename it (the project we are using for demonstration is named *_Petclinic_*, so we name the file `petclinic.graphqls`).

Now we go to VS Code and start creating the frontend project.

From the VS Code start screen press *_Ctrl+Shift+P_* to make the *_Show All Commands_* window appear.

Type *_Amplicode_* into the search field. From the results that appear, select *_Amplicode: Init Frontend_*.

The next parameter to enter will de *_Destination_*. Click on the *_Folder_* icon and pick the folder that you want to contain your project. You can create it, if necessary, from the same window.

The result will look as below. Press *_Enter_*.

The next parameter to choose will be Client Type. Select *_Ant Design Based_*.

On the next step, you name the project.

The next step will be to upload the `.graphqls` file. Choose the file that we previously stored (petclinic.graphqls) in a separate folder and upload it.

For *_Backend Port_* keep the default value of 8080. For *_Generator Version_* use the current default value of 0.39.0. Click *_Generate_*.

Wait while the plugin installs all the necessary packages.

Click on the *_Explorer_* icon.

Open the folder (there will be a prompt), click *_Trust the Author_*. The project has been created. You can see the project tree on the left now.
