= Working with the Project

[[npm-install]]
== Running npm install

In order to work with the project, we need to run the `npm install` command first.

Open the *_Show All Commands_* window, type `terminal` and select *_Create New Terminal_*.

Type `npm install` in the new terminal window and wait until the process is complete.

[[run-debug]]
== Running the Project in the Debug Mode

Before running the new frontend project in VS Code, you will need to run the corresponding backend application in IntelliJ IDEA using the debug icon (image:debug.png[align=center]).

Return to VS Code, open the `package.json` file and run the project in the Debug mode.

Click *_Debug_* -> *_dev vite_*.

Open localhost:3000 in any browser. You will see the Welcome screen of the new frontend application. An alternative way to launch the frontend is to execute `npm run dev` in the terminal.

[[typescript]]
== Running the TypeScript type Generator

You can also run the background TypeScript type generator. To do it, simply run the following command from the terminal:

[source, bash]
npm run generate:watch

Now every time you add, remove or change GraphQL operations, it will trigger generation of TypeScript types.

For one-time generation, run the following command:

[source, bash]
npm run generate
