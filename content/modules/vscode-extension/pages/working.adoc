= Working with the Project

In order to work with the project, we need to install npm.

Open the *_Show All Commands_* window, type `terminal` and select *_Create New Terminal_*.

Type *_npm install_* in the new terminal window and wait until the installation is complete.

Open the package.json file and run the project in the Debug mode.

Open localhost:3000 in any browser. You will see the Welcome screen of the new frontend application.

You can also run a background TypeScript type generator. To do it, simply run the following command from the terminal:

[source, bash]
npm run generate:watch

Now every time you add, remove or change GraphQL operations, it will trigger generation of TypeScript types.

For one-time generation, run the following command:

[source, bash]
npm run generate
