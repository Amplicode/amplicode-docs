== About Spring for GraphQL API

GraphQL is a query language whose development started in 2012. It is open-source and supports query and data manipulation for APIs. GraphQL has been implemented in several programming languages, including Java, by different teams, and its Java implementation is named *_GraphQL Java_*.

*_Spring for GraphQL_* has been developed to support Spring-based applications that use GraphQL Java and  is the successor of the *_GraphQL Java Spring_* project from the GraphQL Java team. This product has found its place in the Amplicode project where it is routinely used to manage data access and modification.

== Supported types and scalars

By default, Spring for GraphQL supports scalar types mentioned in the GraphQL specification, namely:

Int - 32-bit signed.
Float - IEEE 754.
String - UTF-8.
Boolean - true/false.
ID - serialized representation - String

Besides, Spring for GraphQL offers an opportunity to add our own scalar types.

Spring for GraphQL is based on GraphQL Java, where the mapping between scalar types and Java types is defined as follows:

|===
|Scalar Type	|Java Type
|Int	|Integer
|Float	|Double
|String	|String
|Boolean	|Boolean
|ID	|String, Integer, Long, UUID, BigInteger
