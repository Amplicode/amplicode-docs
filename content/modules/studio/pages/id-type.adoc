= ID Type

An ID scalar in a GraphQL schema is an indicator of a simple autogenerated identifier.

In `graphql-java`, and ID scalar can correspond to one of the following Java types:

. `java.lang.String`
. `java.lang.Integer`
. `java.lang.Long`
. `java.util.UUID`
. `java.math.BigInteger`

To interact with a client the ID scalar should be serialized as a string.

Examples of the ID scalar representation in JSON by Java type are given in the table below:

|===
|Java type	|JSON presentation	|JSON Sample
|java.lang.String	|An UTF‐8 string	|"uniquecode"
|java.lang.Integer	|An UTF-8 string	|"1"
|java.util.UUID	|An UTF‐8 string	|"4e083530-0b9c-11e1-9b41-6bdaa41bff94"
|java.lang.Long	|An UTF-8 string	|"123456"
|java.math.BigInteger	|An UTF-8 string	|"2147483647"
|===

Examples of using ID scalars in the GraphQL schema:

+1.+ In a type declaration

[source, java]
type OwnerDTO {
  id: ID
  address: String
  city: String
  email: String
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  telephone: String
}

In this case, the `id` field will be an identifier for `OwnerDTO`, since it has an `ID` type.

+2.+ In an input declaration

[source, java]
input OwnerDTOInput {
id: ID
address: String
city: String
email: String
firstName: String
lastName: String
telephone: String
}

In this case the `id` field will also be an identifier for `OwnerDTOInput`, since it has an `ID` type.

+3.+ In a mutation for deleting an object by id

[source, java]
"Mutation root"
type Mutation {
delete_Owner(id: ID!): Void
}

+4.+ In a query for loading an object by id

[source, java]
"Query root"
type Query {
owner(id: ID!): OwnerDTO
}

Technically, several ID fields can be declared for an object; in this case, the user has to select in the wizard which field to use as the ID.
