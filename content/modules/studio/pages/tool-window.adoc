= Tool Window

Once you install Amplicode and create your first Amplicode project (or download en existing project and open it), you will find its Tool Window (1) on the right-hand side of your IDE window. There will also be an additional toolbar (2) at the upper part of the window containing the source code of the file, as long as you have at least one file opened. This is called *_Editor Toolbar_*.

Amplicode Studio (from now on we are going to refer to it simply as *_Studio_*) provides the following panels within the Tool Window:

 * Structure (1)
 * Palette (2)
 * Inspector (3)

[[structure]]
== Structure
The *_Structure_* tab offers a comprehensive, data-centric view of the project. You can use it for various purposes:

 * Traverse through the data model and observe the entity structure represented hierarchically. This feature allows for easy navigation to entities referencing the current one, as well as ones that the current entity refers to. This is an extremely useful feature, especially for those who are new to an existing project with a large entity graph or for code reviewers who have limited time to understand how the data model is designed.
 * Create data-related objects: entities, JPA converters / Hibernate custom types, Spring Data repositories and Liquibase changelog.
 * Observe related Spring Data repositories, DTOs and projections for each entity.
 * Edit additional project artifacts such as DB connections, persistence units, and other artifacts that the plugin could not detect automatically.

Below, you can see the upper and the lower fragments of the *_Structure_* panel side by side with sections partially expanded.

[[palette]]
== Palette
The *_Palette_* is located on the Designer tab, in the upper part of the panel. It can look differently in different contexts.

The version of the *_Palette_* for JPA entities is shown below:

The *_Palette_* aims to generate code appropriate in the current context. For an entity, it can be an attribute or an index; for a repository - a query method, etc. Hence, the different look of the *_Palette_* depending on the type of the file that you are editing.

The *_Palette_* provides code-generation wizards for the following:

 * Attributes
 * Lifecycle Callbacks
 * Indexes
 * Named Query
 * Reverse Engineering
 * Utilities â€“ Equals/HashCode/ToString

[[inspector]]
== Inspector

The *_Inspector_* is designed to edit existing code: attributes, indexes, queries, etc.

The *_Inspector_* allows you to configure JPA entities and attributes in it. Click on any element that you need to configure, and change the required properties:

[[hibernate-validations]]
=== Hibernate validations

Amplicode projects by default have the Hibernate Validator library enabled. It allows us to define a metadata model and API for entity and method validation.

Inspector contains a section with validations, which you can apply to an attribute. To make it appear, select an attribute in the source code:

Note that the properties and validations offered by the Inspector depend on the data type of the attribute. For example, the set of properties and validations offered for an Integer attribute will be different from a String attribute, etc...

[[editor-toolbar]]
== Editor Toolbar

Editor Toolbar contains relevant actions depending on the file content. You can find it on top of the editor window.
