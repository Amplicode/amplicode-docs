= Tool Window

Once you install Amplicode and create your first Amplicode project (or download en existing project and open it), you will find its Tool Window (1) on the right-hand side of your IDE window. There will also be an additional toolbar (2) at the upper part of the window containing the source code of the file, as long as you have at least one file opened. This is called *_Editor Toolbar_*.

Amplicode Studio (from now on we are going to refer to it simply as *_Studio_*) provides the following panels within the Tool Window:

 * Structure (1)
 * Palette (2)
 * Inspector (3)

[[structure]]
== Structure
The *_Structure_* tab offers a comprehensive, data-centric view of the project. You can use it for various purposes:

 * Traverse through the data model and observe the entity structure represented hierarchically. This feature allows for easy navigation to entities referencing the current one, as well as ones that the current entity refers to. This is an extremely useful feature, especially for those who are new to an existing project with a large entity graph or for code reviewers who have limited time to understand how the data model is designed.
 * Create data-related objects: entities, JPA converters / Hibernate custom types, Spring Data repositories and Liquibase changelog.
 * Observe related Spring Data repositories, DTOs and projections for each entity.
 * Edit additional project artifacts such as DB connections, persistence units, and other artifacts that the plugin could not detect automatically.

Below, you can see the upper and the lower fragments of the *_Structure_* panel side by side with sections partially expanded.

[[palette]]
== Palette
The *_Palette_* is located on the Designer tab, in the upper part of it. It can look differently in different contexts.

The version of the *_Palette_* for JPA entities is shown below:

The *_Palette_* aims to generate code appropriate in the current context. For an entity, it can be an attribute or an index; for a repository - a query method, etc. Hence, the different look of the *_Palette_* depending on the type of the file that you are editing.

[[inspector]]
== Inspector

The *_Inspector_* is designed to edit existing code: attributes, indexes, queries, etc. All changes made in the Inspector are reflected immediately in the source code. Likewise, all the changes done manually in the source code will be reflected in the Inspector.

Click on any element that you need to configure, and change the required properties. Note that the Inspector has a very different look depending on whether you are working with Entities or with Repositories. Below is an example of the Inspector that deals with Entity attributes.

For a Repository, the Inspector acquires a completely different look:

[[editor-toolbar]]
== Editor Toolbar

Editor Toolbar contains relevant actions depending on the file content. You can find it on top of the editor window.

The toolbar contains the following icons:

 * Show DDL image:show-ddl.png[align=center]

 * Select in JPA Structure image:select-in-jpa-structure.png[align=center]

 * References image:references.png[align=center]

 * Add Entity Attribute image:add-entity-attribute.png[align=center]

 * Add Lifecycle Callback Method image:add-lifecycle-callback-method.png[align=center]

 * Add Index image:add-index.png[align=center]

 * Add Named Query image:add-named-query.png[align=center]

 * Spring Data Repositories image:spring-data-repositories.png[align=center]

 * DTOs and Spring Data Projections image:dtos-and-spring-data-projections.png[align=center]

[[icon-functions]]
=== Icon Functions

*_Show DDL_* displays database-related information for the currently opened Entity.

image::show-ddl-output.png[align=center]

You can also choose a different database for the Entity using this popup window.

*_Select in JPA Structure_* automatically shows the currently selected object in the Structure panel. If you are currently working with the Designer tab, the Tool Window will switch to Structure.

The *_References_* icon displays references for the currently selected object in the source code.

*_Add Entity Attribute_*, as the name suggests, provides means for creating attributes for the current Entity (an alternative to the Palette).

image::add-entity-attribute-output.png[align=center]

*_Add Lifecycle Callback Method_*, again, as is obvious from the name, provides an interface for creating lifecycle callback methods.

image::add-lifecycle-callback-output.png[align=center]

With *_Add Index_* you can add indexes or unique constraints to the database.

image::add-index-output.png[align=center]

*_Add Named Query_* provides an interface for creating different types of named queries.

image::add-named-query-output.png[align=center]

The icon named *_Spring Data Repositories_* shows the repository related to the currently opened Entity and offers an opportunity to create more repositories.

image::spring-data-repositories-output.png[align=center]

Finally, DTOs and Spring Data Projections is the icon that gives us access to various actions that are necessary for working with Spring Data Projections and DTOs.
