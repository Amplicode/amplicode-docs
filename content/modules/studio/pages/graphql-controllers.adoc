== About Spring for GraphQL API

The main library used by Amplicode applications for creating the API layer is *_Spring for GraphQL_*.

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#overview[Spring for GraphQL Overview - Spring Documentation]

The application's API is defined by https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#controllers[annotated controllers], i.e. classes annotated as `@Controller` and containing annotations belonging to Spring for GraphQL, e.g. `@MutationMapping`, `@QueryMapping`, etc.

This GraphQL API can be used both by external integrated applications and by the React-based UI.

Amplicode Studio contains comprehensive means for creating GraphQL controllers and data transfer objects (DTOs) connected to them.
