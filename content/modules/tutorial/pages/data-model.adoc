= 2. Data Model

Once the project is created and a database connection set up, the next step is to create the data model.

We will start with creating the Doctor entity.

In the left-side panel, right-click _src_ -> _main_ -> _java_ -> _com.company.doctorsdemo_ and select *_New_* -> *_Package_*. This way we will separate the entities from each other by placing them in different packages.

A window will pop up. Name the new package "_doctor_" and press *_Enter_*.

Now, right-click the newly created folder and select *_New_* -> *_JPA Entity_*.

In the popup window put *_"Doctor"_* into the *_"Name"_* field, select *_"Long"_* from the "Id" drop-down and select the *_"Identity"_* radio button for *_"Id generation"_*.

Click "Ok". The Amplicode plugin will generate a new .java file containing a standard class for the new entity.

Besides, now we have a *_"Designer"_* tab added. Let us click on it and see what it offers.

The upper part of the Designer panel is called a *_Palette_*; the lower one is an *_Inspector_*. The Palette contains all possible actions that can be carried out with the entities, and the Inspector allows us to view and edit the properties of the selected component.

These tools will help us add the attributes to the *_"Doctor"_* entity.

Right-click *_Attribute_* -> *_Basic Type_* and select *_"Add to Source"_*.

Put *_"firstName"_* into the *_"Name"_* field and check the *_"Mandatory"_* checkbox. Click *_"Ok"_*.

Now we can use the Inspector to finish setting up the *_firstName_* attribute. We will carry out the following
actions:

 * Limit the maximum length of the String to 127

 * Make the attribute a *_Not Null_*

image::not-null.png[align=center]

 * Set the minimum length of the String to 2.

Repeat the same step to create the *_lastName _* attribute.

The last attribute we need, *_specialty_*, is an Enum, and it will require a slightly different procedure.
Right-click the "Doctor" entity in the project tree and select *_New_* -> *_Java Class_*.

image::new-enum.png[align=center]

Select *_Enum_* in the popup window.

Type *_"Specialty"_* in the *_"Name"_* field above. Press *_Enter_*.

IntelliJ IDEA will create an empty class for the new ENUM.

image::enum-template.png[align=center]

Fill it in as shown below. You can copy and paste the code directly from this page.

[source,java]
public enum Specialty {
    GP,
    ALLERGY_AND_IMMUNOLOGY,
    DERMATOLOGY,
    OPHTALMOLOGY,
    NEUROLOGY,
    PSYCHIATRY
}

Now we need to turn this Enum into a new attribute for the *_Doctor_* entity.

Double-click the *_"Doctor"_* entity in the project tree to return to the Doctor.java file, then  select *_Attribute_* -> *_Enum_* -> *_Add to Source_* from the Palette.

Select *_"Specialty"_* from the Type drop-down list and check the *_"Mandatory"_* checkbox. Click *_"Ok"_*. Amplicode will generate the necessary source code.
