= 2. Data Model

Once the project is created, the next step is to create the data model.

[[entities]]
== Creating Entities

We will start with creating the *_Doctor_* entity.

In the project tree, right-click `src` -> `main` -> `java` -> `com.company.doctorsdemo` and select *_New_* -> *_Package_*. We will separate backend code related to each of the entities by placing all entities in different packages.

image::new-package.png[align=center]

A window will pop up. Name the new package `doctor` and press *_Enter_*.

image::new-package-naming.png[align=center]

Now, right-click the newly created package folder in the project tree and select *_New_* -> *_JPA Entity_*.

image::new-jpa-entity.png[align=center]

In the popup window put `Doctor` into the *_Name_* field, select `Long` from the *_Id_* drop-down and select the *_Identity_* radio button for *_Id generation_*.

image::entity-completion.png[align=center]

Click *_OK_*. Studio will generate a new Java class for the new entity.

image::doctor-java-class.png[align=center]

[[designer]]
== Designer Tab

Besides, now we have a *_Designer_* tab added. Let us click on it and see what it offers.

image::designer.png[align=center]

The upper part of the Designer panel is called a *_Palette_*; the lower one is an *_Inspector_*. The Palette contains all possible actions that can be carried out with the entities, and the Inspector allows us to view and edit the properties of the selected component.

These tools will help us add the attributes to the `Doctor` entity.

[[attributes]]
== Creating Attributes

Right-click *_Attribute_* -> *_Basic Type_* and select *_Add to Source_*.

image::add-to-source.png[align=center]

Put `firstName` into the *_Name_* field and check the *_Mandatory_* checkbox. Click *_OK_*.

image::firstname.png[align=center]

Now we can use the Inspector to finish setting up the `firstName` attribute. We will carry out the following
actions:

 * Make the attribute a *_Not Null_*

image::not-null.png[align=center]

 * Set the minimum length of the String to 2.

image::min-length.png[align=center]

Repeat the same steps to create a `lastName` attribute.

[[enum]]
=== Creating an ENUM Attribute

The last attribute we need, `specialty`, is an Enum, and it will require a slightly different procedure.
Right-click the `Doctor` entity in the project tree and select *_New_* -> *_Java Class_*.

image::new-enum.png[align=center]

Select *_Enum_* in the popup window.

image::enum.png[align=center]

Type *_Specialty_* in the *_Name_* field above. Press *_Enter_*.

image::specialty.png[align=center]

The IDE will create an empty class for the new ENUM.

image::enum-template.png[align=center]

Fill it in as shown below. To save time, you can copy and paste the code directly from this page.

[source,java]
public enum Specialty {
    GP,
    ALLERGY_AND_IMMUNOLOGY,
    DERMATOLOGY,
    OPHTALMOLOGY,
    NEUROLOGY,
    PSYCHIATRY
}

Now we can add a new attribute for the `Doctor` entity, which will be based on this enum class.

Double-click the `Doctor` entity in the project tree to return to the `Doctor` class, then  select *_Attribute_* -> *_Enum_* -> *_Add to Source_* from the Palette.

image::enum-attribute.png[align=center]

Select *_Specialty_* from the Type drop-down list and check the *_Mandatory_* checkbox. Change *_Enum type_* to *_STRING_*. Click *_OK_*. Studio will generate the necessary source code.

image::enum-attribute-creation.png[align=center]

[TIP]
By changing Enum type to String, we have instructed the JPA library (Hibernate) to store enumeration values by using string representation of the enumeration constant.

Now we need to create the `Patient` entity. In order to do this, simply repeat all the steps you've just done for the `Doctor` entity, starting with the new package, but excluding the `Enum`-related part. Namely:

 * Create a new package named `patient`
 * Create a new JPA Entity named `Patient` inside this package
 * Create a firstName attribute, make it Mandatory, NotNull and set the min length to 2
 * Create a lastName attribute, make it Mandatory, NotNull and set the min length to 2.

Notice that instead of right-clicking *_Basic Type_* in Palette and then choosing *_Add to Source_*, you can either double-click *_Basic Type_* or drag-and-drop it to the window containing the code of your class. We suggest that you try out these alternative methods while creating the attrobutes for the `Patient` entity.

[TIP]
The same is true for any other Palette item. Examples will be given below.

 The result is shown below:

image::patient-class.png[align=center]

[[association-attributes]]
=== Creating Association Attributes

The next step is to create an `Appointment` entity to complete our data model. Create the `appointment` package and the `Appointment` JPA Entity inside it as you did for the previous two entities.

image::appointment-entity.png[align=center]

This entity needs two attributes - `patient` and `doctor` - which are actually references to our two previously created classes. In order to create these attributes, we will have to use the *_Association_* attribute type.

Select *_Attributes_* and double-click *_Association_*.

image::association-create.png[align=center]

Select *_Doctor_* from the *_Type_* drop-down box, leave the *_Cardinality_* with the default value of *_Many to One_* and check the *_Mandatory_* check box. Click *_OK_*.

image::many-to-one.png[align=center]

Studio will generate the necessary code for the `doctor` attribute.

image::private-doctor.png[align=center]

Put your cursor on the `doctor` attribute in the source code. Change the *_Fetch type_* from *_EAGER_* to *_LAZY_* in the Inspector. Make the attribute *_NotNull_*.

image::lazy.png[align=center]

image::mandatory.png[align=center]

These changes will be reflected in the source code.

Repeat exactly the same steps for the `Patient`:

 * Add a new Association attribute to source (for training purposes, feel free to try the drag-and-drop method this time).
 * Set the type to `Patient`
 * Leave the Cardinality with the default value of Many to One and check the Mandatory check box
 * Make the new attribute NotNull and change Fetch type to LAZY.

Now we need to create the remaining attributes. Since they are not associations, we will once again use the already familiar *_Basic Type_* attribute creation procedure.

Select *_Attribute_* -> *_Basic Type_* -> .*_Add to Source_*, fill in the fields as shown on the image below and click *_OK_*.

image::time.png[align=center]

Make this field *_NotNull_* and *_Future_* in the Inspector (appointments cannot be booked for the past).

image::time-validations.png[align=center]

For the `status` attribute create a new Enum. Set the Enum type to ORDINAL. Add the possible values (you can copy and paste the code below):

[source, java]
----
public enum Status {
    PENDING,
    MISSED,
    IN_PROGRESS,
    CANCELLED,
    FINISHED
}
----

[TIP]
By using a ORDINAL enum type, we have instructed the JPA library (Hibernate) to store enumeration values as ordinal number of their constants in the enum class definition.

Return to the `Appointment` class and create the `status` attribute.

image::status-enum.png[align=center]

Make it *_NotNull_* in the Inspector.

Lastly, we create the `duration` attribute, which means the duration of the appointment in minutes.

It is a Basic Type attribute with the `Integer` type. It should also be mandatory.

image::duration.png[align=center]

Make it *_NotNull_* and *_Positive_* in the Inspector.

image::duration-validations.png[align=center]

[[calculated]]
=== Creating a Calculated Attribute

We are also going to need another attribute, `endTime`. It will not be specified directly by the user, but it will be calculated from `startTime` and `duration`. It will be necessary to efficiently search for possible conflicting appointments in the database, since our application will be programmed to be able to reject conflicting appointments.

Select *_Attributes_* -> *_Basic Type_* -> *_Add to Source_*, then from the *_Type_* drop-down box select *_LocalDateTime_*, the same way as we did for `startTime`, name the new attribute `endTime`
and click *_OK_*.

image::endTime.png[align=center]

This attribute doesn't have to be designated as Mandatory.

 We are going to need another Palette entry named *_Lifecycle Callbacks_* to create a calculated attribute.

image::callbacks.png[align=center]

In this particular case we need only one callback called `PrePersist`. Double-click it, and Studio will create an empty method for calculations.

The `@PrePersist` method is invoked by the JPA framework (Hibernate) just before the newly created entity is being saved to the database. It provides a convenient place to fill values for calculated attributes.

image::prepersist.png[align=center]

To calculate `endTime`, we need to add `duration` in minutes to `startTime`. The Java code to do it looks as follows:

[source, java]
----
    @PrePersist
    public void prePersist() {
        if (startTime != null)
            endTime = startTime.plusMinutes(duration);
    }
----

The implementation of our data model has been completed.

[[summary]]
== Summary
In this section, you have created the data model for the project.

You have learned that:

* Studio's Designer tab consists of the Palette and the Inspector.
* Palette can be used to create attributes for entities.
* Inspector can be used to fine-tune the settings for attributes.
* Apart from basic type attributes it is also possible to create custom type attributes (such as enum), association attributes and calculated attributes.
