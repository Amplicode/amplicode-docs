= 2. Data Model

Once the project is created, the next step is to create the data model.

[[entities]]
== Creating Entities

We will start with creating the *_Doctor_* entity.

In the left-side panel, right-click _src_ -> _main_ -> _java_ -> _com.company.doctorsdemo_ and select *_New_* -> *_Package_*. This way we will separate the entities from each other by placing them in different packages.

image::new-package.png[align=center]

A window will pop up. Name the new package "_doctor_" and press *_Enter_*.

image::new-package-naming.png[align=center]

Now, right-click the newly created folder and select *_New_* -> *_JPA Entity_*.

image::new-jpa-entity.png[align=center]

In the popup window put *_"Doctor"_* into the *_"Name"_* field, select *_"Long"_* from the "Id" drop-down and select the *_"Identity"_* radio button for *_"Id generation"_*.

image::entity-completion.png[align=center]

Click "Ok". The Amplicode plugin will generate a new .java file containing a standard class for the new entity.

image::doctor-java-class.png[align=center]

Besides, now we have a *_"Designer"_* tab added. Let us click on it and see what it offers.

image::designer.png[align=center]

The upper part of the Designer panel is called a *_Palette_*; the lower one is an *_Inspector_*. The Palette contains all possible actions that can be carried out with the entities, and the Inspector allows us to view and edit the properties of the selected component.

These tools will help us add the attributes to the *_"Doctor"_* entity.

Right-click *_Attribute_* -> *_Basic Type_* and select *_"Add to Source"_*.

image::add-to-source.png[align=center]

Put *_"firstName"_* into the *_"Name"_* field and check the *_"Mandatory"_* checkbox. Click *_"Ok"_*.

image::firstname.png[align=center]

Now we can use the Inspector to finish setting up the *_firstName_* attribute. We will carry out the following
actions:

 * Limit the maximum length of the String to 127

image::length-limit.png[align=center]

 * Make the attribute a *_Not Null_*

image::not-null.png[align=center]

 * Set the minimum length of the String to 2.

image::min-length.png[align=center]

Repeat the same step to create the *_lastName _* attribute.

The last attribute we need, *_specialty_*, is an Enum, and it will require a slightly different procedure.
Right-click the "Doctor" entity in the project tree and select *_New_* -> *_Java Class_*.

image::new-enum.png[align=center]

Select *_Enum_* in the popup window.

image::enum.png[align=center]

Type *_"Specialty"_* in the *_"Name"_* field above. Press *_Enter_*.

image::specialty.png[align=center]

IntelliJ IDEA will create an empty class for the new ENUM.

image::enum-template.png[align=center]

Fill it in as shown below. You can copy and paste the code directly from this page.

[source,java]
public enum Specialty {
    GP,
    ALLERGY_AND_IMMUNOLOGY,
    DERMATOLOGY,
    OPHTALMOLOGY,
    NEUROLOGY,
    PSYCHIATRY
}

Now we need to turn this Enum into a new attribute for the *_Doctor_* entity.

Double-click the *_"Doctor"_* entity in the project tree to return to the Doctor.java file, then  select *_Attribute_* -> *_Enum_* -> *_Add to Source_* from the Palette.

image::enum-attribute.png[align=center]

Select *_"Specialty"_* from the Type drop-down list and check the *_"Mandatory"_* checkbox. Click *_"Ok"_*. Amplicode will generate the necessary source code.

Now we need to create the *_Patient_* entity. In order to do this, simply repeat all the steps you've just done for the Doctor entity, starting with the new package, but excluding the Enum creation, since a patient doesn't have a specialty. For a patient we only need the firstName and lastName attributes.

image::patient-class.png[align=center]

Now we need an *_Appointment_* entity to complete our data model. Create the *_appointment_* package and the *_Appointment_* JPA Entity inside it as you did for the previous two entities.

image::appointment-entity.png[align=center]

This entity needs two attributes - patient and doctor - which are actually references to our two preciously created classes. In order to create these attributes we will have to edit the source code of the new Java class directly.

Go to Appointment.java source code file and type:

[source, java]
private Doctor doctor;

IntelliJ IDEA will prompt you to click _Alt+Enter_ and a popup window will appear. It will ask you to create either *_"Many to One"_* or *_"One to One"_* relationship between the entities.

image::many-to-one.png[align=center]

Select *_Many to One_*. Amplicode will generate the necessary annotations and the getter/setter code for the *_doctor_* variable.

image::private-doctor.png[align=center]

Repeat the same steps for the *_"Patient"_*. The resulting source code of the *_Appointment.java_* class should look like this:

[source, java]
----
package com.company.doctorsdemo.appointment;

import com.company.doctorsdemo.doctor.Doctor;
import com.company.doctorsdemo.patient.Patient;

import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "appointment")
public class Appointment {
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
@Column(name = "id", nullable = false)
private Long id;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "doctor_id")
    private Doctor doctor;

    public Doctor getDoctor() {
        return doctor;
    }

    public void setDoctor(Doctor doctor) {
        this.doctor = doctor;
    }

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "patient_id")
    private Patient patient;

    public Patient getPatient() {
        return patient;
    }

    public void setPatient(Patient patient) {
        this.patient = patient;
    }
}
----

Feel free to copy and paste this block of code into your application if you are having difficulties generating it.

Put your cursor on the "doctor" variable in the source code. Change the *_Fetch type_* from _EAGER_ to _LAZY_ in the Inspector. Make the attribute Mandatory and NotNull.

image::lazy.png[align=center]

image::mandatory.png[align=center]

These changes will also be reflected in the source code.

Now we need to create the remaining attributes. Since they are not associations, we will once again use Amplicode's wizards to create them.

Select *_Attribute_* -> *_Basic Type_* -> .*_Add to Source_*, fill in the fields as shown on the image below and click "Ok".

image::time.png[align=center]

In the Inspector make this field *_NotNull_* and *_Future_* (appointments cannot be booked for the past).

image::time-validations.png[align=center]

For the status attribute create a new Enum. Your Status.java class should look like this:

[source, java]
----
package com.company.doctorsdemo.appointment;

public enum Status {
    PENDING,
    MISSED,
    IN_PROGRESS,
    CANCELLED,
    FINISHED
}
----

Return to the Appointment.java class and create the *_status_* attribute.

image::status-enum.png[align=center]

Make it a NotNull in the Inspector.

Lastly, we create the "duration" attribute, which means the duration of the appointment in minutes.

It is a Basic Type attribute with the Integer type. It should also be mandatory.

image::duration.png[align=center]

Make it NotNull and Positive in the Inspector.
