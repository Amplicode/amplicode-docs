= 1. Project Setup

In this chapter you will go through a few simple steps to set up a new project. You will learn how to navigate the project structure and locate essential components. Once your project is set up, you will be able to run it and explore its pre-built features.

[[dev-env]]
== Setting Up Development Environment

Visit the general xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[] page to see if you have all prerequisites set that are necessary for the tutorial. Notice that though we mention PostgreSQL as optional in the general scheme of things, it will be mandatory for this tutorial and needs to be installed.

[[create-project]]
== Creating Project

In this section you will learn how to create a new Amplicode-based project from a template and how to set up a database connection.

 * If you have another project open in your IntelliJIdea, close it.

 * Click the _**New Project**_ button in the upper right corner.

 * Select "Amplicode Project" from the left-side menu.

 * Choose the template version. For now, it should be 0.4.0-SNAPSHOT, since some f the other versions are still work in progress and may generate incorrect code.

 * Click _**"Next"**_.

 * Choose _"Amplicode Java project (Maven)"_ from the list of templates.

* Click _**"Next"**_.

* Name the project. In our case the name will be _doctorsdemo_.

* Click _**"Create"**_.

Now Amplicode will automatically generate the new project and open it in IntelliJ IDEA.

Please pay attention to the Amplicode panel that will appear on the right side of the IntelliJ IDEA screen.

This panel will be actively used in the course of building our demo application, namely, *_"Data Sources"_*, *_"GraphQL"_* and the upper toolbar, from which we will use the "Add New Actions" (image:add-new-actions.png[align=center]) pictogram and the "Regenerate GraphQL Schema" (image:regenerate-graphql.png[align=center]) one. In the future, while actively using the Amplicode plugin, you will doubtless make use of the other tools contained by this panel.
