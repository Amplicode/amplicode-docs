= 1. Project Setup

In this chapter you will go through a few simple steps to set up a new project. You will learn how to navigate the project structure and locate essential components. Once your project is set up, you will be able to run it and explore its pre-built features.

[[dev-env]]
== Setting Up Development Environment

Visit the general xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[] page to see if you have all prerequisites set that are necessary for the tutorial. Notice that though we mention PostgreSQL as optional in the general scheme of things, it will be mandatory for this tutorial and needs to be installed.

[[create-project]]
== Creating Project

In this section you will learn how to create a new Amplicode-based project from a template and how to set up a database connection.

 * If you have another project open in your IntelliJIdea, close it.

 * Click the _**New Project**_ button in the upper right corner.

 * Choose the template version. For now, it should be 0.2.3-SNAPSHOT, since newer versions are still work in progress.

 * Click _**"Next"**_.

 * Choose _"Amplicode Java project (Maven)"_ from the list of templates.

Now Amplicode will automatically generate the new project and open it in IntelliJIDEA.
