= 1. Project Setup

In this chapter you will go through a few simple steps to set up a new project. Once your project is set up, you will be able to run it and explore its pre-built features.

[[dev-env]]
== Setting Up Development Environment

Visit the general xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[] page to see if you have all prerequisites set that are necessary for the tutorial.

[[create-project]]
== Creating Project

In this section you will learn how to create a new Amplicode-based project from a template.

 * If you have another project open in your IDE, close it.

 * Click the _**New Project**_ button in the upper right corner.

 * Select *_Amplicode_* from the left-side menu.

 * Choose the template version. We recommend using the template version suggested by default.

 * Click _**Next**_.

 * Choose *_Amplicode Java project (Maven)_* from the list of templates.

* Click *_Next_*.

* Name the project. In our case the name will be `doctorsdemo`.

* Click *_Create_*.

Now Studio will automatically generate the new project and open it in the IDE.

[[amplicode-panel]]
== Amplicode Panel

Please pay attention to the *_Amplicode_* tab and the corresponding panel that will appear on the right side of the IDE screen.

This panel will be actively used in the course of building our demo application, namely, *_GraphQL_* and the upper toolbar, from which we will use the *_Add New Actions_* (image:add-new-actions.png[align=center]) and the *_Regenerate GraphQL Schema_* (image:regenerate-graphql.png[align=center]) pictograms. In the future, while actively using the Studio, you will doubtless make use of the other tools included in this panel.

[[summary]]
== Summary
