= Tutorial

This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Amplicode by walking you through building a simple full-stack web application. It covers the entire development process, from data modelling to creating UI.

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Java and relational databases, as well as frontend development basics, such as HTML and TypeScript.

[[install]]
== Installation

Check system requirements and install Amplicode Studio and Java Development Kit (JDK) as described in the xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[] section.

[[about-app]]
== About the Sample Application

The application will simulate the work of a clinic portal offering patients a service for booking appointments with doctors. For the purpose of this tutorial the business logic will be simplified and include only the most important features.

Through the step-by-step application building process the tutorial will demonstrate how to use Amplicode to create the backend part of the application, including entities, repositories, controllers and organize work with the database. We will then implement the business logic and demonstrate how to work with the frontend part by creating a simple CRUD screen and setting up the necessary connection between backend and frontend.

The application will make use of several types of data: String, Integer, LocalDateTime, and Enum.

[[data-model]]
=== Data Model

In most cases it is necessary to design the data model before starting to develop an application, and this is true for Amplicode-based applications as well.

The Patient is the entity that contains Patient's  information, such as first name and last name.

The Doctor is an entity that includes available information about every doctor that can be used to book appointments.

Finally, an Appointment connects patients with doctors and also contains additional information about every appointment, such as the start time, the status and the duration.
