= Tutorial

This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Amplicode Studio by walking you through building a simple full-stack web application. It covers the entire development process, from data modelling to creating UI. From this moment on, Amplicode Studio will be referred to simply as *_Studio_*.

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Java and relational databases, as well as frontend development basics, such as HTML and TypeScript. We are going to use IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate edition), which will be referred to as IDE from this moment on.

[[install]]
== Installation

Check system requirements and install Amplicode Studio and Java Development Kit (JDK) as described in the xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[] section.

[[about-app]]
== About the Sample Application

The application will simulate the work of a clinic website that offers hospital staff a service for booking appointments between patients and doctors. For the purpose of this tutorial, the business logic will be simplified and include only the most important features.

Through the step-by-step application building process, the tutorial will demonstrate how to use Studio to create the backend part of the application, including entities, repositories and controllers. We will then implement the business logic and demonstrate how to work with the frontend part by creating several simple CRUD screens and setting up the necessary connection between backend and frontend.

The application will make use of several types of data: a string, a number, a date and an enumeration.

[[data-model]]
=== Data Model

In most cases it is necessary to design the data model before starting to develop an application, and this is true for Amplicode-based applications as well.

The `Patient` is the entity that contains patient's  information, such as first name and last name.

The `Doctor` is an entity that includes available information about every doctor that can be used to book appointments.

Finally, an `Appointment` connects patients with doctors and also contains additional information about every appointment, such as the start time, the status and the duration.
