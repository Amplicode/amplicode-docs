[[system]]
== Check System Requirements

Make sure your computer meets the following requirements:

* 64-bit operating system: Windows, Linux or macOS.

* Memory – 16 GB is recommended.

* Hard drive free space – at least 20 GB.

[[software]]
== Install the Necessary Software

Make sure you have the following software installed:

 * IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3.3 or newer
 * Node.js 16.20.0 with npm 8.* (using either older or newer versions of Node.js and/or npm is not recommended, since they are not compatible with Amplicode at the moment)
 * A database engine of your choice, e.g. PostgreSQL (optional)

While downloading and installing IntelliJ IDEA for working with the Amplicode plugin, keep in mind that if you are planning to work with both backend and frontend, you will need the Ultimate edition of the IDE, which is commercial software distributed with a 30-day trial period. If you intend to work with backend only, the Community edition (provided free of charge) will be enough.

You can choose and download the suitable version of IntelliJIDEA by visiting _https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html_. This page contains both Community and Ultimate editions of the IDE suitable for various operational systems and dating from 2012 till the present time.

[[nodejs]]
=== Installing the Correct Version of Node.js and Npm

Currently, in order to work with the Aplicode plugin and be able to create the frontend part of the application you need particular versions of Node.js and npm installed, namely Node.js 16.20.0 with npm 8.*.

In order to check which version of Node.js you have, you can use the following command:

[source, bash]
 node -v

You can run it in the terminal window of your IDE.

To check the actual version of npm, run the following command:

[source, bash]
 npm -v

If you don't have the software installed or have the wrong versions, you will have to install the correct versions of both Node.js and npm. Failure to do so will make it impossible to create the frontend part of your application.

 * If you have Node.js of another version installed, uninstall it.
 * Go to _https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.20.0/_, choose _**node-v16.20.0-x64.msi**_ from the list and download it.

image::setup/nodejs-download.png[align=center]
 * install the downloaded file.

This distribution already contains the necessary version of npm. However, if you already have the correct version of Node.js and only need to change the version of npm to 8, you can run the following command in the terminal (make sure you have administrator's rights or use _**sudo**_ if you are working under Linux):

[source, bash]
npm -g install npm@8

Now you have all the necessary prerequisites for using the Amplicode plugin.

[[jdk]]
== Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

**TODO**

Download JDK version 17 (for example, https://adoptium.net[Eclipse Temurin^] or https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads[Liberica^] JDK) and install it to a directory suggested by the installer. This is enough for creating and running applications from the IDE.

To run Amplicode applications from the terminal, set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable as described below.

* On *Windows*, create the `JAVA_HOME` variable with the path to the installed JDK root directory at *Computer* -> *Properties* -> *Advanced System Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Environment variables*. The variable should be added to the *System variables* list.

* On *macOS* and *Linux* set `JAVA_HOME` in `~/.bash_profile` or another appropriate file of your shell, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/liberica-jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home"
----

* Restart the computer to make sure the environment variable has taken effect.

* Check correctness of the environment variable by running the following command in the console:
+
--

.On Windows
[source,bash]
----
"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java" -version
----

.On Linux and macOS
[source,bash]
----
"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" -version
----

The command should return the Java version, e.g. `17.0.6`.
--

CAUTION: If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, some Java system properties must be passed to the JVM running development tools and Gradle. xref:studio:install.adoc#working-behind-proxy[Configure] these properties using Jmix Studio.

[[Troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

Depending on the size of your project, you may need to increase available memory for the IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle processes.

. In IntelliJ IDEA, open *Help -> Edit Custom VM Options...* and edit the `-Xmx` parameter (it's usually on top). The recommended value is `2048m` or more, for example:
+
[source,text]
----
-Xmx2048m
----

. Edit the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file and set the `-Xmx` parameter in the `org.gradle.jvmargs` property. The recommended value is `2048m` or more, for example:
+
[source,properties]
----
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m
----
